    "description": "As I Lay Dying is a novel by American author William Faulkner. Faulkner said that he wrote the novel from midnight to 4:00 AM over the course of six weeks and that he did not change a word of it.[1] Faulkner wrote it while working at a power plant, published it in 1930, and described it as a \"tour de force.\" Faulkner's seventh novel, it is consistently ranked among the best novels of 20th-century literature.[2][3][4][5] The title derives from Book XI of Homer's The Odyssey, wherein Agamemnon speaks to Odysseus: \"As I lay dying, the woman with the dog's eyes would not close my eyes as I descended into Hades.\"",
