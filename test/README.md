Test
====

Put all of your tests here.

## Directories

### Setup
Put any test setup files you need here.

**Files:**
- node.js: sets up the unit tests to run in node with jsdom
- helpers.js: small helpers to be executed before the rest of your tests (global `beforeEach` and `afterEach` blocks)

### Unit
Put all of your unit test specs here. Match the directory structure of `src` exactly and use `.spec.js` as the file extension. Otherwise you will have trouble getting your tests to run.
